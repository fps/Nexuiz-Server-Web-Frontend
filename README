- What's this?

	A simple web frontend to control a nexuiz server

- How to use it?

	1. Get web2py from http://www.web2py.com/
	2. Put the nexuiz_server application into the applications/ folder
	3. Run python web2py.py in the main directory
	4. Point your browser to the machine you have web2py started on. Default is port 8000

- Requirements?

	- You need to have rcon.pl in your PATH. Make sure it's able to communicate with your
	  nexuiz server process by trying it manually, e.g.:

	  rcon_address="localhost:26000" rcon_password="123" rcon.pl status

	  This should give you status feedback of your server..
